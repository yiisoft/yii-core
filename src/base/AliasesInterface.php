     * Registers a path alias.
     *
     * A path alias is a short name representing a long path (a file path, a URL, etc.)
     * For example, we use '@yii' as the alias of the path to the Yii framework directory.
     *
     * A path alias must start with the character '@' so that it can be easily differentiated
     * from non-alias paths.
     *
     * Note that this method does not check if the given path exists or not. All it does is
     * to associate the alias with the path.
     *
     * Any trailing '/' and '\' characters in the given path will be trimmed.
     *
     * See the [guide article on aliases](guide:concept-aliases) for more information.
     *
     * @param string $alias the alias name (e.g. "@yii"). It must start with a '@' character.
     * It may contain the forward slash '/' which serves as boundary character when performing
     * alias translation by [[getAlias()]].
     * @param string $path the path corresponding to the alias. If this is null, the alias will
     * be removed. Trailing '/' and '\' characters will be trimmed. This can be
     *
     * - a directory or a file path (e.g. `/tmp`, `/tmp/main.txt`)
     * - a URL (e.g. `http://www.yiiframework.com`)
     * - a path alias (e.g. `@yii/base`). In this case, the path alias will be converted into the
     *   actual path first by calling [[getAlias()]].
     *
     * @throws InvalidArgumentException if $path is an invalid alias.
     * @see getAlias()
     */

    /**
     * Translates a path alias into an actual path.
     *
     * The translation is done according to the following procedure:
     *
     * 1. If the given alias does not start with '@', it is returned back without change;
     * 2. Otherwise, look for the longest registered alias that matches the beginning part
     *    of the given alias. If it exists, replace the matching part of the given alias with
     *    the corresponding registered path.
     * 3. Throw an exception or return false, depending on the `$throwException` parameter.
     *
     * For example, by default '@yii' is registered as the alias to the Yii framework directory,
     * say '/path/to/yii'. The alias '@yii/web' would then be translated into '/path/to/yii/web'.
     *
     * If you have registered two aliases '@foo' and '@foo/bar'. Then translating '@foo/bar/config'
     * would replace the part '@foo/bar' (instead of '@foo') with the corresponding registered path.
     * This is because the longest alias takes precedence.
     *
     * However, if the alias to be translated is '@foo/barbar/config', then '@foo' will be replaced
     * instead of '@foo/bar', because '/' serves as the boundary character.
     *
     * Note, this method does not check if the returned path exists or not.
     *
     * See the [guide article on aliases](guide:concept-aliases) for more information.
     *
     * @param string $alias the alias to be translated.
     * @param bool $throwException whether to throw an exception if the given alias is invalid.
     * If this is false and an invalid alias is given, false will be returned by this method.
     * @return string|bool the path corresponding to the alias, false if the root alias is not previously registered.
     * @throws InvalidArgumentException if the alias is invalid while $throwException is true.
     * @see setAlias()
